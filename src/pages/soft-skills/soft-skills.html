              As an App Developer, soft skills are one of the most important steps towards a successful App.<br>
              <br>
              During the hole developing process you are facing lots of challenges which require leadership, teamwork,
              communication, problem solving or interpersonal skills.<br>
              <br>
              My strengths are that I can quickly integrate myself into a team and then work on my tasks reliably.
              This you can particularly see in my previous group projects, where I often took the lead and worked effectively with my team.
