      <p>My name is Tom Smolarek, I am 21 years old and I am studying Information Management Automotive in Ulm, Germany
        but currently I am doing a semester abroad in Finland at the Laurea University.<br>
        <br>
        Here I took the course Introduction to Mobile App Design and Development where I learned all about Ionic
        programming
        and how to create the best UX with your App.<br>
        <br>
        My strengths are that I can quickly integrate myself into a team and then work on my tasks reliably.
        This you can particularly see in my previous group projects, where I often took the lead and worked effectively
        with my team.
