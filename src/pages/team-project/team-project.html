              During the course Introduction to Mobile App Design and Development I learned all the basic knowledge 
              you need to become a real App Developer.<br>
              For the project in this course I decided to work on my one, because it is very important to fully 
              understand how the framework is build and how it works.<br>
              After having a good understanding of the ionic framework, I am ready to work together with other Developer and 
              create an awesome App together.
